					<h4>Points and Bidding</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Each time an item is upbid, the auction resets to 3 day timer.  Make aggressive bids to avoid the auctions lasting a week or longer</li>
						<li>Stone, ely, alps, and demonforge gear can only use points from its own zone, so if you have 100 stone points you may bid only 100 on stone gear</li>
						<li>All other zones require 10% points from its own zone, so if you have 100 kalata points, you can bid 1000 points on kalata gear</li>
						<li>Your 'Available' points is total points minus points tied up in bids. Points become available again if you're outibd</li>
						<li>There's no auction expiry / outbid notices at this time - watch the list carefully!</li>
						<li>A full Elysium Day 1 run is worth 10080 points, split among runners</li>
