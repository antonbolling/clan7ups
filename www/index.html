					<h3>UPS News</h3>
					<div class="ups-news-item" style="background-color:rgb(240,240,240);">
						<h4>January 22 2013</h4>
						Introducing <b>Percent Attendance</b>! When submitting new runs, leaders now put each runner's percent attendance, and ups calculates the points each runner receives. It is now impossible to modify an individual runner's points. The old system of leaders typing in points directly has been removed.
					</div>

						<h4>January 19 2013</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Eq search by keyword now works!  Searching 'gold scale' will return anything with 'gold' and 'scale' in the description.  UPS doesn't know about med keywords, so 'well' won't work for 'portable hole'.</li>
							<li>Session now automatically times out in 7 days instead of 30 minutes.</li>
							<li>Estate has been split into three "days": (1) everything but count/nemesis, (2) count, and (3) nemesis. A full estate including count and nemesis must be submitted as three separate "days". This allows partial estate runs without creating extra points.</li>

					<h4>Points and Bidding</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Each time an item is upbid, the auction resets to 3 day timer.  Make aggressive bids to avoid the auctions lasting a week or longer</li>
						<li>Stone, ely, alps, and demonforge gear can only use points from its own zone, so if you have 100 stone points you may bid only 100 on stone gear</li>
						<li>All other zones require 10% points from its own zone, so if you have 100 kalata points, you can bid 1000 points on kalata gear</li>
						<li>Your 'Available' points is total points minus points tied up in bids. Points become available again if you're outibd</li>
						<li>There's no auction expiry / outbid notices at this time - watch the list carefully!</li>
						<li>A full Elysium Day 1 run is worth 10080 points, split among runners</li>
					</ul>
